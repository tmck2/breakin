# breakin

##Breakout Clone written in Elm

I wrote this game as an exercise to learn the Elm language.

##Build Instructions

elm-make breakin.elm --output=breakin.js

##TODO

- Intro screen
- Game over screen
- High score
- Paddle collision is a bit weird (e.g. if the ball collides with the side of the paddle, bounces back to the top)
